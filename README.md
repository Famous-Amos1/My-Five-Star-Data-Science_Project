Job 1:
Retail Sales Analysis & Product Category Prediction
Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end retail data analysis and machine learning solution designed to extract actionable business insights from transactional sales data. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling to help retail businesses better understand customer purchasing behavior and improve product decision-making.

The notebook demonstrates how raw retail data can be transformed into clear insights and deployable predictions using Python and industry-standard data science workflows.

Business Problem:
Retail companies often struggle to:
Understand customer purchase patterns
Identify high-performing product categories
Predict product demand accurately
Make data-driven inventory and marketing decisions
This project addresses these challenges by building a multiclass classification model that predicts product categories based on transaction features.

Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
Scikit-learn – machine learning & evaluation
Jupyter Notebook – reproducible analysis

 Key Features of the Project:
✔ Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing
✔ Feature selection and encoding
✔ Multiclass Logistic Regression model
✔ Model performance evaluation
✔ Business-oriented insights and interpretations

 Key Insights:

Clear identification of purchasing trends across product categories
Patterns in customer transactions that influence product selection
Demonstration of how predictive analytics can support retail strategy

Machine Learning Approach:
Problem Type: Multiclass Classification
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Target Variable: Product Category
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy and classification performance metrics
The model serves as a strong baseline that can be extended to more advanced algorithms for production use.

JOB 2: 
Customer Segmentation & Clustering Analysis
Project Overview
This project presents a data‑driven customer segmentation analysis for the Famous Amos retail dataset using unsupervised machine learning (clustering). The notebook demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into actionable business insights that support marketing strategy, customer targeting, and revenue optimization.
Rather than focusing only on algorithms, the work emphasizes clear thinking, interpretability, and business relevance — exactly how real‑world analytics should be done.

Objectives

Identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior
Understand how customers differ in spending patterns and frequency
Translate clusters into practical business recommendations
Demonstrate a professional, end‑to‑end data science workflow

What Makes This Work Stand Out:
✔ Thoughtful data preprocessing and feature selection
✔ Appropriate use of clustering techniques (not over‑engineering)
✔ Strong focus on interpretation, not just model output
✔ Business‑oriented storytelling with the results
✔ Clean, well‑structured, and reproducible notebook

This project reflects how analytics is actually applied in retail, FMCG, and customer intelligence teams.

Tools & Techniques Used:
Python
Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation
Scikit‑learn – clustering algorithms & preprocessing
Matplotlib / Seaborn – visual insights
K‑Means Clustering
Feature scaling & cluster evaluation techniques

Key Insights Delivered:
Clear identification of high‑value vs low‑value customers
Behavioral differences between customer groups
Actionable segmentation that can inform:
Promotions & loyalty programs
Product bundling strategies
Targeted marketing campaigns
The analysis bridges the gap between machine learning outputs and business decision‑making.

About the Author
This notebook was created by a data professional with strong analytical intuition and business awareness. The author demonstrates:
Ability to translate complex models into simple insights
Strong command of applied machine learning
A results‑oriented mindset focused on value creation
Clean, professional, and client‑ready analysis style
This is the kind of work expected from someone who understands both data science and the business context it serves.
